# DESCRIPTION:
Online recipe book is an application used to find food recipes based on the ingredients you provide. You can choose a category, whether you want breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, vegetarian options, food for kids and more. Based on what category you choose you will be shown recipes of that type. There are also multiple choices for recipes, generally these 3 types:
 - Recipes that do not require more ingredients than you can provide;
 - Recipes that require one more ingredient based on what you have;
 - Recipes that require more than one ingredient, sorted by number of ingredients needed.

Users will be able to leave feedback and rating for each recipe.
Each day there will be a different recipe shown as a "Recipe of the day" to everyone. Users will also have the option of receiving mails with daily recipes, or having updates on new meals.
Optionally, there will be a possibility of ordering the missing ingredients for a certain recipe from a local supermarket that has delivery.

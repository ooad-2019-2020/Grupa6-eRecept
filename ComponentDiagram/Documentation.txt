After starting the application, users can log in or register. This will be made possible by the main component. Furthermore, users can also 
see their saved recipes which will be provided by the user controller. Users can search available recipes by various filters or leave feedback 
on meals they have made, which will be provided by the component for controlling recipes. If the user is an admin, then additional functions 
are available such as adding new recipes, modifying existing recipes, account manipulation settings (approving/deleting users). This will be 
provided by the main component.

When it comes to web services, we are using RESTful type of web service. This means any data presented on the website is fetched via 
appropriate web service. For example, if we want to display all recipes, we will make a GET request to RecipeController that will provide us 
with data containing all recipes, or if we want to update a recipe we will use PUT http method, or if we want to add a new recipe we will use 
POST http method. The same goes for IngredientController and UserController.
